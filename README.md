# Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator

The **Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator** project calculates key statistical metrics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum) for a given list of 9 numbers. The input list is reshaped into a 3x3 matrix, and the calculations are performed along different axes, as well as for the flattened version of the array.

## Libraries Used
- `numpy`: For numerical operations and statistical calculations


## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the script to calculate the statistical metrics:
   ```bash
   python mean_variance_standard_deviation_calculator.py

## Project Goals

- To calculate key statistical metrics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, sum) for a list of 9 numbers, reshaped into a 3x3 matrix.
- Perform the calculations along the rows, columns, and the entire flattened array, providing a comprehensive view of the dataset.
